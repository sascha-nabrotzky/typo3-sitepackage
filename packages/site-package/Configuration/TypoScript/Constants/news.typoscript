# News-Extension: In the most common case, where you want to override the standard news 
# template with your own templates you can use the TypoScript constants 
# to set the paths:

plugin.tx_news {
   view {
      templateRootPath = EXT:site-package/Resources/Private/Extensions/News/Templates/
      partialRootPath = EXT:site-package/Resources/Private/Extensions/News/Partials/
      layoutRootPath = EXT:site-package/Resources/Private/Extensions/News/Layouts/
   }
}
